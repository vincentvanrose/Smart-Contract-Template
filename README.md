# smart-contract-docs-template

Reusable documentation templates for Solidity smart contracts, designed for Web3 projects and dApp developers.

## Overview

This repository provides templates for documenting smart contracts clearly and comprehensively. Good contract documentation helps developers integrate with your protocol, auditors review your code, and users understand what they're interacting with.

## What's Included

- **Contract Reference Template** — Document a single contract's functions, events, and state variables
- **Function Documentation Template** — Detailed template for complex or critical functions
- **Protocol Overview Template** — High-level architecture documentation for multi-contract systems
- **Deployment Guide Template** — Instructions for deploying contracts to various networks
- **Integration Guide Template** — Help external developers integrate with your contracts
- **Security Considerations Template** — Document known risks, access controls, and audit status
- **Glossary Template** — Define protocol-specific terminology

## Who This Is For

- Smart contract developers documenting their own protocols
- Technical writers working on Web3 projects
- Teams preparing for audits or public launches
- Projects building developer ecosystems around their contracts

## Using These Templates

1. Choose the template that fits your documentation need
2. Copy the template file to your project
3. Replace placeholder content with your contract details
4. Adapt the structure as needed for your specific protocol

## Documentation Philosophy

Smart contract documentation should be:

- **Precise** — Blockchain interactions are irreversible. Ambiguity in documentation can lead to lost funds.
- **Complete** — Document all public and external functions, not just the common paths.
- **Security-conscious** — Call out risks, access controls, and trust assumptions explicitly.
- **Example-driven** — Show how to call functions with realistic parameters and expected outputs.
- **Versioned** — Contracts are immutable once deployed. Tie documentation to specific deployments and addresses.
